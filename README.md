# Splash
 "Splash" is a console process manager that allows you to control processes in your operating system through the command line.

 With "Splash," you can get a list of running processes, terminate processes, suspend or resume process execution, and find a process by its name or identifier.

 One of the main advantages of "Splash" is its speed due to the lack of a graphical user interface. This allows for fast and accurate process management, especially in  cases where every millisecond counts.
